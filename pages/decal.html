      <b>Digital Tools For Architecture</b><br>
      In the spring of 2019, I co-instructed an introductory architecture course
      with one of my best friends. It was called Arch 98: Digital Tools for
      Architecture. We had taken a similar course in our freshman year and
      was how we first met. During that time we talked with the student instructors
      and learned that they wished it to continue after they would graduate. A year and a half later
      we decided to offer our own version of it. We changed the syllabus and
      material quite a bit, focusing on software and concepts we thought were
      the most important to get a good foundation in as an undergraduate architecture
      major. The course ended up going well and we were really pleased with the
      work our students produced over the semester.
      <br><br>
      The following semester, both with some time on our hands and
      having come back from design jobs over the summer, we wanted to work together
      on something but were unsure on what. We went to a lecture by Irma Boom, known as <em>The Queen of Books</em>.
      We left that lecture inspired and decided to make a small anthology
      of our studentsâ€™ final projects. Having no prompt it was an original piece.

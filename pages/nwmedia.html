      <b>New Media 203:</b> Critical Making<br>
      <b>Professor:</b> Eric Paulos <br>
      <b>Team:</b> Mimi Shalf, Lili Dai, Arnold Yeung, Yani Mai, Steffan Cross <br><br>

      I took Critical Making in the spring of 2019 and it was one of the most
      rewarding classes I took in college. Every single class felt worthwhile
      and engaging, rare. The course was centered around design, art, and technology
      with 3 large group projects and a series of smaller individual ones. <br><br>

      One of those larger group projects had a simple focus, movement. Our group wanted to
      take a lighter approach and design a kids toy. Our initial
      inspiration came from the dollies that Arnold and I played with in elementary
      school PE class. Thinking back to those times we thought of the ways we used to play
      with those dollies, their shortcomings, and possibilities to make them more fun.
      We also consulted with one of our mentors, who was previously a toy designer
      and also knew these dollies well as his daughter played with them frequently in school. <br><br>

      Through our memories and consultations, we found that the dollies were only
      designed to be used as a single object. But, especially in school settings, kids want to and
      do play in groups. To get around that sometimes they’ll connect the dollies
      with ropes or hang onto each other. We saw a lot of potential to adapt and
      make a toy designed for and encouraging of group play. <br><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      ABC Toy Dolly is a modular toy dolly based on children’s toy dollies and furniture
      dollies that encourages creativity and collaboration in group games. With embedded
      sensors, LED Lights, magnetic connectors and an accompanying app, ABC Toy Dolly
      can provide a wide range of games and help reimagine these classic toys. <br><br>

      Alongside being used as they always have been, multiple games and configurations
      can be chosen through the app. Some games we planned for the dollies were Blob Tag,
      Space Invader, and Freeze Tag. With Blob Tag, for example, the LEDs on the tagger’s
      board would be red while all others would be blue. When the tagger gets within close
      range of another board the hall effect sensors trigger and the board’s LEDs
      switch from blue to red. Then those two boards link together and the game continues,
      compelling the kids to think of unique ways to link their boards and use teamwork to
      catch their targets. <br><br>

        I took Critical Making in the spring of 2019 and it was probably one of
        the most rewarding classes I've ever taken in college. Every single class felt worthwhile
        which is really rare. The course was centered around design and social impact but
        my favorite project that came out of the course was just focused on play.

      <p>
        ABC Toy Dolly is a modular toy dolly based on children’s toy dollies and
        furniture dollies that encourages creativity and collaboration in group
        games.  With embedded sensors, LED Lights, magnetic connectors and an
        accompanying app, ABC Toy Dolly can provide a wide range of games and help
        reimagine the definition of play. <br><br>
        Multiple games and configurations can be chosen through the app, and are
        represented by different colors of LED lights on the bottom of the dolly.
        Some games we planned for the dolly were Blob Tag, Space Invader, and Freeze
        Tag.  The sensors are embedded in the side of the dollies and when two
        dollies connect the sensors can trigger the lights to change depending on
        the game being played.  Players can also use the magnetic connectors to
        create different configurations and come up with new games to play.

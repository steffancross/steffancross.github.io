          Hi,
          <br><br>
          I graduated from UC Berkeley majoring in Design and Fabrication and with
          a minor in Architecture. Currently I'm located in the Bay Area and looking for work
          in the design field.
          <br><br>
          I admire objects that have an aspect of discovery to them. As a user, having some
          agency and being able to experience an object in more ways than immediately
          apparent is incredibly rewarding and something I endeavour my designs to contain.
          <br><br>

      During the spring of 2019, I took Industrial Engineering 170: Industrial Design
      and Human Factors. Instead of being a design-centric course like I had been
      accustomed to, the course was more research-centric. It was focused on understanding
      the human form and how to consider it properly when designing for it. This ended
      up being one of the most practical courses I took during my time at Berkeley
      and taught me about the multiple levels one needs to consider when designing
      products for people. <br><br>

      Our final project was a redesign of an everyday object but with a focus on ergonomics
      and interaction. The object chosen for my group was a watering can. <br><br>

      At first, we were a little perplexed with what we could do to change the watering
      can and what was even wrong with it in the first place. However, as we researched
      more, we found that it was an object with quite a few problems and of all the
      redesigns done to it, only a small minority made an attempt to remedy its issues. <br><br>

      We found the <em>Union Products 2-Gallon Watering Can</em> to be one of the most popular
      cans and used it as a standard to compare against. 2 gallons of water translates
      to 16.7lbs and when considering that of the hobby gardener population, the
      average age is 50 years old and 60% are female, 16.7lbs isn’t a trivial weight.
      Further, the conventional design requires it to be placed on the ground when
      filling, so, again for that population, bending over and picking up that can
      is another burden along with carrying it from the from where it was filled
      to the plants. During our interviews, we found that these actions are compounded
      as the average person refills the can 1-2 times per session. <br><br>

      However, the biggest issue by far was the wrist flexion under tension while pouring.
      As we found results on the internet and through our interviews, that wrist
      motion with weight compounded over thousands of pours, can lead to serious
      injuries. But even long before those added up, many felt discomfort or fatigue
      in their wrists after watering. <br><br>

      With these issues in mind, we designed a can that strayed far from the form
      of a conventional watering can. It has a long spout, two large wheels, and
      a cross grip. We did away with the bending and carrying, instead, one holds
      the grip near the spout and pulls the can behind from destination to destination.
      When it comes time to water, without bending over to lift, the can is pulled
      up from a standing position with both hands. Then, one hand is transferred
      to the cross grip and the other to the grip along the body. To pour the cross
      grip is used to support the weight while the can rotates on its wheel axis,
      driven by an up and down motion and eliminating the wrist strain that had been
      the main culprit of injuries in the conventional design.<br><br>

      <p>
        This project is a redesign of the conventional watering can. We chose the
        watering can because despite the many redesigns and variations that continue
        to come out, not much really changes. All the same issues that were
        present from the start, still remain. The main issue is the wrist action
        associated with pouring from a watering can. However, when looking at the
        whole process from filling to transport to watering and back again, even
        more arise. We tried to address the entire use-cycle with our design.
      </p>

      <p>
        We began and spent most of our time researching. To provide a thorough solution
        we needed to understand: the current offerings, demographics, ways of use,
        and common injuries. Our engagement with design assumptions centered around
        a strong ideal of minimalism, and reducing the entire perception of our product
        to one of practicality and curiosity over technology and complexity, with
        group discussion being driven around the following image from an early lecture
        slide.

      <p>
        While exploring current watering cans on the market we found the <em>Union
        Products 2-Gallon Watering Can</em> to be one of the most popular out there
        and used that as the standard to compare against in our design iterations.
        To understand the issues facing this can we did a Rapid Entire Body Assesment
        (REBA), used to asses the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) of a task,
        on it and got a resulting score of 6. While this isn’t conclusive of a
        dangerous task, it does show there is a considerable risk especially over
        the course of hundreds to thousands of pours.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also conducted a few informal interviews with hobby gardeners and found
        first and foremost, associations of wrist pain when or after using a traditional
        watering can. We also found discomfort with the transportation and weight
        of the can as well. Of the hobby gardener population, the average age is
        50 years old and 60% are female. To this population, bending over and
        lifting a 20lb can is not an easy task. These became the two main problem points
        that we addressed with our design.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the majority of hobby gardeners are older we designed for the lower
        bell curve for older women. Our target population was the 5th percentile
        of older women. We choose this because if it would be comfortable for an
        older woman to use then it should be for practically anyone else.

        Our final design is of a watering can that strays far from the form of a
        conventional watering can. It has a long spout, two large wheels, and a
        cross grip. With this design, we did away with all the bending over and
        carrying that was normally done. Instead, one holds the rubberized grip
        near the top and rolls the can behind from destination to destination. When
        it comes time to water, without bending over to lift, the can is pulled
        up from a standing position with both hands. Then, one hand is transferred
        to the cross grip and the other to the grip along the body. To pour the
        cross grip is used to support the weight while the can rotates on its
        wheel axis, driven by an up and down motion of the other hand eliminating
        the wrist strain that had been the main culprit of injuries in the conventional
        design. We reassessed our design with REBA and got a final score of 2,
        indicating low risk and a 4 point increase from the standard.

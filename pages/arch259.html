      <b>Architecture 259:</b> Bending and Folding Structures<br>
      <b>Professor:</b> Simon Schleicher <br>
      <b>Team:</b> Eric Del'Orco, Tina Piracci, Benjamin Taube, Steffan Cross<br><br>

      In this class, our project prompt was to make something that utilized
      bending or folding in the design. Our group, being all architecture students who are
      used to making objects at building scale, instead wanted to make
      something at the product scale.<br><br>

      As one of us had just taken a seminar on building acoustics, we thought that
      would be an interesting route to take in combination with a folding structure.
      And, having all had experiences working in open floor plan offices we thought
      the biggest shortcoming of them is sound privacy.<br><br>

      While open plans are great in that there is hardly any construction required
      and the arrangement of furniture can be fluid. Constantly being able to hear
      what others are saying or having background chatter while on calls is unprofessional
      and harms focus. When researching the issue
      we found that of all the dissatisfactions in the office environment, sound
      privacy is by far the number one.<br><br>

      Because of this, we settled on designing some sort of deployable structure
      that when folded, took up little to no room, but when unfolded provided an
      acoustically private environment from exterior sounds. We first started by
      looking at precedent work and also different scales to target, ultimately
      deciding to make a foldable dome that could house up to six people for meetings.<br><br>

      And, because we didn’t want to just send noise back into the office space
      we decided absorption would be the best route to go. Gratefully, the human
      range of speech isn’t very large so we were able to settle on materials and
      layering that would absorb it sufficiently.<br><br>

      We decided on using a thick acoustic felt and very dense acoustic
      foam due to their cost and weight. The acoustic foam would be cut to panel
      size and then sandwiched between sheets of the felt. The felt serves two
      purposes, it absorbs some sound and is pliable enough to work as a hinge.
      Because of this, we didn’t need hinges on every panel while at the
      same time are able to have a completely sealed container such that no noise
      could leak through small cracks.<br><br>

      Form finding took the most of our time as making a dome collapsible was
      much harder than any of us had imagined. One of our early prototypes collapsed
      to be quite compact but the deployment wouldn’t drop down from the
      ceiling like we’d imagined. <br><br>

      During the course, we worked in collaboration with students from
      the University of Tokyo and Tomohiro Tachi who made <em>Freeform Origami</em>,
      the software we used frequently alongside <em>Grasshopper</em>. With his help,
      the help of our professor and a few models and iterations, we were able to settle on a form.

      <h4>Abstract</h4>
      <p>
        isoDome is a deployable acoustic pod for open-plan offices. Inspired by origami
        folding patterns, the concept for isoDome came as a solution to the number
        one source of dissatisfaction from occupants in open-plan offices: sound
        privacy. Research shows that among all factors of indoor environmental quality,
        users are least satisfied with the acoustics of their spaces. We wanted to
        create a solution to this problem that can be seamlessly integrated into
        virtually any office design. In its folded state, isoDome hangs from the
        ceiling and passively works as an acoustic sound baffle. It is constructed
        using a variety of acoustic materials to absorb office sounds. The geometry
        created by the folding pattern reflects sound waves within itself to further
        attenuate the sound. If users want to have an impromptu meeting or create a
        quiet space for focused work, isoDome can be deployed, creating a pod large
        enough to accommodate 4-6 people seated around a table, providing both visual
        and acoustic privacy from the rest of the office. Integrated lighting illuminates
        the newly created workspace inside.<br><br>
        isoDome provides users with a flexible, on-demand option to modify their
        workspace to meet their needs. Private offices and conference rooms are
        expensive to build, permanent, and occupy valuable floor space all the
        time even if they are only used intermittently. isoDome is easily hung
        from a conventional ceiling and it doesn’t take up any floor space when
        it is in its folded state. By combining layers of acoustic materials, isoDome
        specifically targets frequencies of sound that are within the range of the
        human voice to create an environment where users have privacy and are free
        of distraction from the rest of the office.

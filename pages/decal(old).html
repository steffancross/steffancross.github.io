    <div class="description">
      In the spring of 2019, I co-instructed an introductory architecture course
      with one of my best friends. It was called Arch 98: Digital Tools for
      Architecture. We had taken a similar course in our freshman year and actually,
      that was how we met. During that time we got close with the instructors
      and they said how’d they wish it would keep going. A year and a half later
      we decided to offer our own version of it. We changed the syllabus and
      material quite a bit, focusing on software and concepts we thought were
      the most important to get a good foundation in as an undergraduate architecture
      major. The course ended up going well and we were really pleased with the
      work our students produced over the semester.
      <br><br>
      The following semester, both with a little to much time on our hands and
      having come back from design jobs over the summer, we wanted to work together
      on something. We went to a lecture by Irma Boom, known as <em>The Queen of Books</em>.
      We left that lecture very inspired and decided to make a small anthology
      of our students’ final projects. Having no prompt it was an original piece for both of us.
      <br><br>
      These are some images of what we made.
